**Iris Flower Classification**

This project aims to classify the species of Iris flowers using machine learning techniques.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is 'iris.csv', which contains measurements of 150 Iris flowers from three different species.

**Dependencies**

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using the following command: pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn

**Description**

Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb: This is a Python script containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization, and prediction.

**Results**

Accuracy of the model on the test set. Confusion matrix showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Classification report displaying precision, recall, F1-score, and support. Pairplot showing the relationships between different features. Countplot of the species in the dataset. Bar plot of the count of each species that has been accurately classified.

**Predictions**

The script also predicts the species for all flowers in the dataset and displays the actual and predicted species.
